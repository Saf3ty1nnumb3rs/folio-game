Hi! Welcome to my WDI-14 project 1.

We are creating an interpretation of HANG MAN (or in the modern vernacular - HANG PERSON). I am a Star Wars nerd so I will be putting a slight SW twist on things.

The project can be found at BitBalloon: http://hangmanproject1.bitballoon.com/ . Enjoy!

Check out my wireframe on Figma https://www.figma.com/file/bgrcuA7km6GNa94tVvhkYAlc/Mandalorian-Hang-Suite.

For all source code and related documents go to GitHub: https://github.com/Saf3ty1nnumb3rs/folio-game .

I used jQuery, javascript, and CSS for this project. Any other libraries are superfluous and will be edited out in this project.
